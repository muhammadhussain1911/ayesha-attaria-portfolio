```

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase (from above)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...

# Cloudinary (from above)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...

## 🔑 Environment Variables Explained

### Public Variables (visible in browser)

```env
# Safe to expose - used by frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=...
```

### Private Variables (server-side only)

```env
# KEEP SECRET - never expose or commit
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
```

**Rule:** If the variable is used in browser code (like image uploads or auth), prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
